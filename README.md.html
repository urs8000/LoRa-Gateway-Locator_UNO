<h1><a id="LoRaWanGateway_Locator_0"></a>LoRaWan-Gateway Locator</h1>
<p>This is an illustration of building a Coverage Measurement Equipment out of standard Arduino parts</p>
<p>The main problem was the “common” usage of pin-10 as ChipSelect (SS*) on the SPI bus.
This interferred between the Dragino board and the SD-Card.
Also to be changed had the Rx/Tx from the Adafruit GPS-Logger board from 7/8 to 4/5 not conflicting with the Dragino pins.</p>
<p>The LMIC 1.5 library used for this project uses itself 30kB of storage, nearly the full memory an UNO offers.
So I use a piggypack board, replacing the 328P-28DIL with a ATmega1284 which has 4 times the memory that an UNO has.</p>

Dragino board Version 1.3 with RFM95W (marked as RFM96!) LoRaWan compatible radio</p>
<p>#Modifications:
all of them are made on the Adafruit GPS shield (see picture Mod_1)</p>
<ol>
<li>cut at the TOP side the traces Tx, Rx &amp; CCS</li>
<li>connect CCS -&gt; 8, Tx -&gt; 5, Rx -&gt; 4</li>
<li>in the software use in the definitions
#define SD_Select      8
#define Drag_Select   10
SoftwareSerial mySerial(5, 4);  // switch in position SW serial!
Adafruit_GPS GPS(&amp;mySerial);
// Pin mapping  for Dragino Board Version 1.3
const lmic_pinmap lmic_pins = {
.nss = 10,
.rxtx = LMIC_UNUSED_PIN,
.rst = 9,
.dio = {2, 6, 7},
};
in setup() you have to configure the two different ChipSelect
pinMode(SD_Select, OUTPUT);       digitalWrite(SD_Select, HIGH);  // DEselect
pinMode(Drag_Select, OUTPUT);  digitalWrite(Drag_Select, HIGH);   // DEselect</li>
</ol>
<p>when writing to the SD card make shure that the Dragino is disabled
digitalWrite(Drag_Select, HIGH);       // disable Dragino_Board_ChipSelect
log_on_SD();                           // write a log to the SDcard
digitalWrite(SD_Select, HIGH);         // disable SDcard_ChipSelect</p>
